## Background

With the necessity to have a username and password for almost everything we do in this world, I was running out of ideas for password. I wanted to have a way to create a password
utilizing letters or words that I might remember, but would still be secure. 

I implemented a sinatra application, that takes in to user inputs.  I permutate those inputs and then generate a password for the user.

## Features/Usage

This is a pretty seamless and simple app to use.  The password is not randomly generated in that it accepts user input in order to generate the password. This way it provides the user some permutation of words or letters that they can remember.  It offers form validation to ensure words of 5 characters in length have been input in to the form fields.


## Development/Contribution

If you have any suggestions of how I can make this app better all suggestions are welcome and appreciated.  I would like to update this so that the user can input what the character length of the password they desire. I ultimately want to figure out a way for user to never have to worry about remembering passwords ever again. 

## Future

What features are you currently working on? Only mention things that you
actually are implementing. No pie-in-the-sky-never-gonna-happen stuff.
