## Background

With the necessity to have a username and password for almost everything we do in life, I was running out of options for password, that would actually be secure. I wanted to create a password, utilizing letters or words of my choice, that would be meaningful to me, but would still be secure, thus making it easier to remember

I implemented a sinatra application, that takes in to user inputs.  I permutate those inputs and then generate a password for the user.

## Features/Usage

This is a pretty seamless and simple app to use.  The password is not randomly generated, in that it accepts user input in order to generate the password. This way it provides the user some permutation of words or letters that they can remember.  It offers form validation to ensure words of 5 characters in length have been input in to the form fields.


## Development/Contribution

If you have any suggestions of how I can make this app better all suggestions are welcome and appreciated.  I would like to update this so that the user can input the character length of the password they desire. I ultimately want to figure out a way for users to never have to worry about remembering passwords ever again. 

## Future
I am looking to refactor this to take into consideration character length
